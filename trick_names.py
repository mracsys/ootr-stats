                    In the northern basement there's a ledge from where, in
                    vanilla Water Temple, boulders roll out into the room.
                    Normally to jump directly to this ledge logically
                    requires the Hover Boots, but with precise jump, it can
                    be done without them. This trick supersedes "Water Temple
                    Boss Key Chest with Iron Boots" and applies to both
                    Vanilla and Master Quest.

                    and float up to the top level. This allows access to this
                    area and lower water levels without Iron Boots.

                    in the Water Temple are not going to be relevant unless this
                    trick is first enabled.
